# MUST READ!
This analogue clock with digital hands shows the time in a 24-hour format. It's a simple project I'm working on so I have an excuse to keep coding.

This program will use the language Python and the library Pygame. I am currently working on a web version as well.

On Windows:
- Open CMD and type `python`.
- You'll be redirected to the MS Store and be shown a window where you can download Python.
- After the installation, head back into CMD and type `python -m pip install pygame`.
- If you see a message indicating a successful installation, you can verify it by running the following command to check the Pygame version: `python -m pygame --version`.

Now that Pygame is installed, you can go to the code. Expect updates!
